#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
#The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
#The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
#After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.


fname=open("mbox-short.txt") #for getting the data from file
counts=dict()
List=list()
for line in fname: #fetching the dat from file
    if line.startswith("From "):
        #checking the line starts with from
        
        line=line.split() 
        #spliting the line which starts with  from
        List.append(line[1]) 
        #now appending the email in a list
#now checking the count of words and storing in a dictionary
